Badging Notes (1/21)

Jaman will be following up with us in a grooming backlog session to discuss the badging initiative, figuring out schedule for that.

Matt will each out to Ed Gaughran

Primarily Explore, potential slack integration down the line.

Build out badging service that can be integrated into explore.

Badging service potentially node back-end javascript application that integrates with explore. Will be its own API.

What do we need for the data?
Queries, CRUD, what are the fields for the Badge object? 

Still researching other company badge implementation.

Nick will look into Slack API integration.

Nick will add notes to repository (https://github.com/excellalabs/excella-badges)

Give read/write access to Explore.

Reach out to JSCA eventually to see folks who want to learn NEST.

Slack API Integration Reference Notes: 
First build an app through:

https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api
https://api.slack.com/events
https://api.slack.com/methods/users.profile.set (most likely relevant to update profile where badge info is maintained)
