Badging notes (1/4):

Priority - help with professional development or help Jaman/recruiters have knowledge of who to put on what contract?
hasn't talked to Jaman yet on whether it would be helpful or if he's interested. Depends on value it can provide him.
original purpose is professional development support

Action Item - reach out to Jaman with general statement on badging and gauge his interest

Explore? Slack? A new application?
- Explore and Slack already exist so easier to build a proof of concept. Can we integrate slack with Explore?

Have bench devs work on it as a bench project. Matt R would serve as PO. Would require prior Python/Django experience if we stuck with Explore

How does one obtain a badge? Based on passing some kind of exam? Based on certifications? Based on proven experience in contract work?

What are different levels?
- intro/advanced

Do we give users any control over badging or will their badges be added by an administrator?
 - Administrator -> Long term plan would be to find a way to automate this based on criteria -> Maybe add customization

What timeframe are we looking at introducing this?
- length of time it takes is dependent on bench
- length of time for introduction would be some point q1 2022

Proof of concept with slack would be useful (understand difficulty of integration)
