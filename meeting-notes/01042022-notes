Badging notes (1/4):

Priority - help with professional development or help Jaman/recruiters have knowledge of who to put on what contract?
hasn't talked to Jaman yet on whether it would be helpful or if he's interested. Depends on value it can provide him.
original purpose is professional development support

Action Item - reach out to Jaman with general statement on badging and gauge his interest

Explore? Slack? A new application?

Explore and Slack already exist so easier to build a proof of concept. Can we integrate slack with Explore?

Have bench devs work on it as a bench project. Matt R would serve as PO. Would require prior Python/Django experience if we stuck with Explore

How does one obtain a badge? Based on passing some kind of exam? Based on certifications? Based on proven experience in contract work?
